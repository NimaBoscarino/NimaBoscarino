### Heya!

I'm Nima! I'm a software engineer and educator based in Vancouver, Canada, and I work as a Developer Advocate over at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co). Take a peek through my repos to find my old lecture material from my days instructing at the Lighthouse Labs web dev bootcamp, as well as some other weird goodies. You find me over on <a rel="me" href="https://hci.social/@nima">Mastodon</a>.

I keep my machine learning demos up on my [Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/NimaBoscarino)! Feel free to reach out on Twitter if you want to chat about ML, software in general, education, or tech ethics ðŸ¤—
